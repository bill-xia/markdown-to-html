# markdown-to-html
This is a naive version of md2html.
Today(2020/4/3), ver 1.0 comes. Although there are known bugs, I put it here, and simply it works for most conditions!
## How to use it
On the first line, there is a variable named filename, and just change it into your filename (without".md"), then run it.
## About the messy code
It's just before semi-finished, and the code is messy and hard to read.
If you have the patience to read it and give some comments or suggestions, I'll appreciate it with all of my heart.
## Future version
In the following versions, I'll make improvements on:
- Fix bugs
- Code readability
- Multi-file support(there may be a little shell for that)
Thanks for your visit, and welcome for you to try.
